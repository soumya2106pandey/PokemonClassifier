# PokemonClassifier

We classify images of Pokémon Ditto, butter free and Pikachu by implementing machine leaning algorithm. We used traditional recognitional model and extracted some human crafted features then trained dataset with various algorithms.

The input for this task are the images of Ditto, Butter free and Pikachu, while the output is classification accuracy on the dataset. Dataset consist of 66 images of butter free, 59 images of Ditto and 198 images of Pikachu. Size of image of these Pokémon were quite distributed so appropriate preprocessing was done to scale them to a similar level.
